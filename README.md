# VBA-challenge
Files for Module 2 Challenge
Creating the code for this VBA challenge was difficult, but rewarding. As I began, I knew that I would need to wrap all of my code into one big for loop so that the code could be carried from one page to the next. I also found that it would make sense to declare all variables within the for loop as I would only need these variables within the loop. I started by declaring the key variables I knew I would need for each loop, like pulling the unique tickers out of column A to later add them to column I. I also needed to create my "i" and "j" variables to be able loop through each column. I ran into a few issues that required some extra research and help from outside sources. I initially had troubles created nested for loops and if statments/conditionals within my loop created with the purpose to go through each worksheet. I also ran into issues with a few of variables. For example, my "tickercount" variable needed a starting value of 2 in order for it to start in the correct position for my loops. Overall, this challenge was just that, a challenge! I enjoyed learning as much as I did in order to complete this assigment.
